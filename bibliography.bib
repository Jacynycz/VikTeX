  abstract	= {While current computing practice abounds with innovations
		  like online auctions, blogs, wikis, twitter, social
		  networks and online social games, few if any genuinely new
		  theories have taken root in the corresponding “top”
		  academic journals. Those creating computing progress
		  increasingly see these journals as unreadable, outdated and
		  irrelevant. Yet as technology practice creates, technology
		  theory is if anything becoming even more conforming and
		  less relevant. We attribute this to the erroneous
		  assumption that research rigor is excellence, a myth
		  contradicted by the scientific method itself. Excess rigor
		  supports the demands of appointment, grant and promotion
		  committees, but is drying up the wells of academic
		  inspiration. Part I of this paper chronicles the inevitable
		  limits of what can only be called a feudal academic
		  knowledge exchange system, with trends like exclusivity,
		  slowness, narrowness, conservatism, self-involvement and
		  inaccessibility. We predict an upcoming social upheaval in
		  academic publishing as it shifts from a feudal to
		  democratic form, from knowledge managed by the few to
		  knowledge managed by the many. The technology trigger is
		  socio-technical advances. The drive will be that only
		  democratic knowledge exchange can scale up to support the
		  breadth, speed and flexibility modern cross-disciplinary
		  research needs. Part II suggests the sort of
		  socio-technical design needed to bring this transformation
		  about.},

  abstract	= {Part I of this paper outlined the limitations of feudal
		  academic knowledge exchange and predicted its decline as
		  cross-disciplinary research expands. Part II now suggests
		  the next evolutionary step is democratic online knowledge
		  exchange, run by the academic many rather than the few.
		  Using socio-technical tools it is possible to accept all,
		  evaluate all and publish all academic documents. Editors
		  and reviewers will remain, but their role will change, from
		  gatekeepers to guides. However, the increase in knowledge
		  throughput can only be supported by activating the academic
		  community as a whole. Yet that is what socio-technical
		  systems do --- activate people to increase common gains.
		  Part 1 argued that scholars must do this or be left behind
		  in the dust of progress. The design proposed here is
		  neither wiki, nor e-journal, nor electronic repository, nor
		  reputation system, but a hybrid of these and other
		  socio-technical functions. It supports print publishing as
		  a permanent archive byproduct useful to a living, online
		  knowledge exchange community. It could also track academic
		  submissions, provide performance transcripts to promotion
		  committees, enable hyperlinks, support attribution, allow
		  data-source sharing, retain anonymous reviewing and support
		  relevance and rigor in evaluation. Rather than a single
		  \"super\" KES, a network of online systems united by a
		  common vision of democratic knowledge exchange is proposed.},

  issn		= {1662-4548},
  doi		= {10.3389/fnins.2015.00169},
  abstract	= {“Classical peer review” has been subject to intense
		  criticism for slowing down the publication process, bias
		  against specific categories of paper and author,
		  unreliability, inability to detect errors and fraud,
		  unethical practices, and the lack of recognition for unpaid
		  reviewers. This paper surveys innovative forms of peer
		  review that attempt to address these issues. Based on an
		  initial literature review, we construct a sample of 82
		  channels of scientific communication covering all forms of
		  review identified by the survey, and analyze the review
		  mechanisms used by each channel. We identify two major
		  trends: the rapidly expanding role of preprint servers
		  (e.g., ArXiv) that dispense with traditional peer review
		  altogether, and the growth of “non-selective review,”
		  focusing on papers' scientific quality rather than their
		  perceived importance and novelty. Other potentially
		  important developments include forms of “open review,”
		  which remove reviewer anonymity, and interactive review, as
		  well as new mechanisms for post-publication review and
		  out-of-channel reader commentary, especially critical
		  commentary targeting high profile papers. One of the
		  strongest findings of the survey is the persistence of
		  major differences between the peer review processes used by
		  different disciplines. None of these differences is likely
		  to disappear in the foreseeable future. The most likely
		  scenario for the coming years is thus continued
		  diversification, in which different review mechanisms serve
		  different author, reader, and publisher needs. Relatively
		  little is known about the impact of these innovations on
		  the problems they address. These are important questions
		  for future quantitative research.},

  keywords	= {},
  abstract	= {While current computing practice abounds with innovations
		  like online auctions, blogs, wikis, twitter, social
		  networks and online social games, few if any genuinely new
		  theories have taken root in the corresponding “top”
		  academic journals. Those creating computing progress
		  increasingly see these journals as unreadable, outdated and
		  irrelevant. Yet as technology practice creates, technology
		  theory is if anything becoming even more conforming and
		  less relevant. We attribute this to the erroneous
		  assumption that research rigor is excellence, a myth
		  contradicted by the scientific method itself. Excess rigor
		  supports the demands of appointment, grant and promotion
		  committees, but is drying up the wells of academic
		  inspiration. Part I of this paper chronicles the inevitable
		  limits of what can only be called a feudal academic
		  knowledge exchange system, with trends like exclusivity,
		  slowness, narrowness, conservatism, self-involvement and
		  inaccessibility. We predict an upcoming social upheaval in
		  academic publishing as it shifts from a feudal to
		  democratic form, from knowledge managed by the few to
		  knowledge managed by the many. The technology trigger is
		  socio-technical advances. The drive will be that only
		  democratic knowledge exchange can scale up to support the
		  breadth, speed and flexibility modern cross-disciplinary
		  research needs. Part II suggests the sort of
		  socio-technical design needed to bring this transformation
		  about.},

  abstract	= {Part I of this paper outlined the limitations of feudal
		  academic knowledge exchange and predicted its decline as
		  cross-disciplinary research expands. Part II now suggests
		  the next evolutionary step is democratic online knowledge
		  exchange, run by the academic many rather than the few.
		  Using socio-technical tools it is possible to accept all,
		  evaluate all and publish all academic documents. Editors
		  and reviewers will remain, but their role will change, from
		  gatekeepers to guides. However, the increase in knowledge
		  throughput can only be supported by activating the academic
		  community as a whole. Yet that is what socio-technical
		  systems do --- activate people to increase common gains.
		  Part 1 argued that scholars must do this or be left behind
		  in the dust of progress. The design proposed here is
		  neither wiki, nor e-journal, nor electronic repository, nor
		  reputation system, but a hybrid of these and other
		  socio-technical functions. It supports print publishing as
		  a permanent archive byproduct useful to a living, online
		  knowledge exchange community. It could also track academic
		  submissions, provide performance transcripts to promotion
		  committees, enable hyperlinks, support attribution, allow
		  data-source sharing, retain anonymous reviewing and support
		  relevance and rigor in evaluation. Rather than a single
		  \"super\" KES, a network of online systems united by a
		  common vision of democratic knowledge exchange is proposed.},

  doi		= {10.3389/fnins.2015.00169},
  abstract	= {“Classical peer review” has been subject to intense
		  criticism for slowing down the publication process, bias
		  against specific categories of paper and author,
		  unreliability, inability to detect errors and fraud,
		  unethical practices, and the lack of recognition for unpaid
		  reviewers. This paper surveys innovative forms of peer
		  review that attempt to address these issues. Based on an
		  initial literature review, we construct a sample of 82
		  channels of scientific communication covering all forms of
		  review identified by the survey, and analyze the review
		  mechanisms used by each channel. We identify two major
		  trends: the rapidly expanding role of preprint servers
		  (e.g., ArXiv) that dispense with traditional peer review
		  altogether, and the growth of “non-selective review,”
		  focusing on papers' scientific quality rather than their
		  perceived importance and novelty. Other potentially
		  important developments include forms of “open review,”
		  which remove reviewer anonymity, and interactive review, as
		  well as new mechanisms for post-publication review and
		  out-of-channel reader commentary, especially critical
		  commentary targeting high profile papers. One of the
		  strongest findings of the survey is the persistence of
		  major differences between the peer review processes used by
		  different disciplines. None of these differences is likely
		  to disappear in the foreseeable future. The most likely
		  scenario for the coming years is thus continued
		  diversification, in which different review mechanisms serve
		  different author, reader, and publisher needs. Relatively
		  little is known about the impact of these innovations on
		  the problems they address. These are important questions
		  for future quantitative research.},
